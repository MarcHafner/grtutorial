  Drug sensitivity and resistance are quantified using IC<sub>50</sub> or
  E<sub>max</sub> values, but these metrics suffer from a fundamental flaw when
  applied to growing cells: they are highly sensitive to the number of divisions
  that take place over the course of a response assay (see the exploration tool
  below). Division rate varies across cell lines and experimental conditions.
  The dependency of IC<sub>50</sub> and E<sub>max</sub> on division rate creates
  artefactual correlations between genotype and drug sensitivity while obscuring
  important biological insights and interfering with biomarker discovery. To
  address this, we derived alternative drug response metrics that are
  insensitive to division number. These metrics are based on estimating growth
  rate inhibition (GR) in the presence of a drug (relative to an untreated
  control) using endpoint or time-course assays. The latter provides a direct
  measure of phenomena such as adaptive drug resistance. Theory and experiments
  published in Hafner et al. (2016) show that GR<sub>50</sub> and GR<sub>max</sub>
  are superior to IC<sub>50</sub> and E<sub>max</sub> for assessing the effects of
  drugs on dividing cells. Moreover, adopting GR metrics requires only modest
  changes in experimental protocols. GR metrics should improve the use of drugs
  to identify response biomarkers, study mechanisms of cell signaling and growth
  and identify drugs effective on specific patient-derived tumor cells. Through
  this website we provide an online tool to calculate GR metrics from
  user-provided data. Scripts are also available on GitHub.

    <h1>Illustration of the dependency of traditional metrics on division time.</h1>
    Simulated data showing relative cell count (green lines) and GR metrics
    (purple lines) for a cytostatic drug assayed over 3 days across cell lines
    with different division times. The darker the line, the longer the division
    time of the cell line (given in days; see key above). IC<sub>50</sub> and
    GR<sub>50</sub> are projected onto the x-axis; E<sub>max</sub> and
    GR<sub>max</sub> are projected onto the y-axis. Note how the IC curves
    suggest a more resistant phenotype for slow-growing cell lines whereas the
    GR curves for all lines overlap, indicating that the GR metrics are
    independent of the division time. An interactive version of this plot can be
    found in the <a href="?currTab=Explore">Exploration tool</a> tab
    of this section.
