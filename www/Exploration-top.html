  We used computer simulation (see below) to model drug response by three
  idealized cell lines having identical sensitivity to a partial, or complete
  cytostatic drug (i.e., a drug that arrests but does not kill cells), or a
  cytotoxic drug (i.e., a drug that kills cells) and different division times
  (<span class="math">T<sub>d</sub></span>). For example, the lower quartile,
  median, and upper quartile of the division times for breast cancer cell lines
  has been reported as 1.8, 2.4, or 3.9 days, respectively (Heiser et al.
  (2012)). These values are similar to those of NCI-60 cells. In a slow-dividing
  cell line (<span class="math">T<sub>d</sub></span> &gt; 3.9 d), the total
  number of cells does not double in a typical three-day assay; thus
  <span class="math">E<sub>max</sub> ≥ 0.5</span> and
  <span class="math">IC<sub>50</sub></span> are undefined. In the case of the
  two faster-growing cell lines, <span class="math">IC<sub>50</sub></span> and
  <span class="math">E<sub>max</sub></span> values fall as division rate
  increases simply because cell number (or CTG value) is normalized to a
  drug-naïve control in which cell number increases as division time falls.
