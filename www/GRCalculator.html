  Through the accompanying webpages we provide online tools that allow users to
  upload their own endpoint data, calculate the corresponding GR values and GR
  metrics, and compare their results across the variables in the assay, such as
  cell line, agent (drug), time and replicate. Through the above
  <a href="http://www.grcalculator.org/grcalculator/"><strong>Online GR
    Calculator</strong></a> webpage, we provide online tools that allow users to
  upload their own endpoint data, calculate the corresponding GR values and GR
  metrics, and compare their results across the variables in the assay, such as
  cell line, agent (drug), time and replicate. Python, R and MATLAB code for
  calculating GR value and GR metrics is also available in the
  <a href="https://github.com/sorgerlab/gr50_tools">gr50_tools repository on GitHub</a>.
  Our R code is also available in the Bioconductor package
  <a href="http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/GRmetrics">GRmetrics</a>.

<h2>Input data</h2>

<p>
  The input .tsv file(s) must have the following column headers (first row of
  the file):
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>concentration</strong>: The concentration of the perturbagen on
    which dose-response curves will be evaluated.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>cell_count</strong>: The number of cells (or a surrogate of cell
    number such as CellTiter-Glo® staining) after treatment.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>cell_count__ctrl</strong>: The cell_count measurement in control
    wells (e.g. DMSO-treated) from the same plate (control cell count).
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>cell_count__time0</strong>: The cell_count measurement in untreated
    wells grown in parallel until the time of treatment (time<sub>0</sub> cell
    count).
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  All other columns will be treated as additional key variables (e.g.
  cell_line, drug, time, replicate).
</p>

<h2>Calculated metrics</h2>

<p>The following GR metrics are calculated:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>GR<sub>50</sub></strong>: The concentration at which the effect
    reaches a GR value of 0.5 based on interpolation of the fitted curve.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>GR<sub>max</sub></strong>: The effect at the highest tested
    concentration.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>GR<sub>inf</sub> = GR(c → ∞)</strong>: The effect at infinite
    concentration based on extrapolation of the fitted curve, which reflects
    asymptotic drug efficacy. Note that GR<sub>inf</sub> can differ from
    GR<sub>max</sub> if the measured dose-response does not reach its plateau
    value.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>GEC<sub>50</sub></strong>, the drug concentration at half-maximal
    effect, which reflects the potency of the drug.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>h<sub>GR</sub></strong>: Hill coefficient of the sigmoidal curve,
    which reflects how steep the dose-response curve is.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>GR<sub>AOC</sub></strong>: The area over the dose-response curve,
    which is the integral of <span class="math">1–GR(c)</span> over the range of
    concentrations tested.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  In addition, the online calculator reports the r-squared of the fit and
  evaluates the significance of the sigmoidal fit based on an F-test. Further
  information about these calculations is available through our GR tutorial.
</p>

<p>
  The results of analysis of existing LINCS dose-response datasets using the GR
  model are available in the
  <a href="http://www.grcalculator.org/grbrowser/">LINCS GR Data Browser</a>
  webpage.

<h2>Analysis and visualization tools</h2>

<p>
  The following tabs allow users to analyze and visualize their data and the
  calculated GR metrics:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Data Tables</strong> displays the uploaded data and calculated GR
    values as well as the inferred GR metrics. Data can be downloaded in .csv or
    .tsv format.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Dose-Response by Condition</strong> plots the data points and fitted
    dose-response curves for each condition. If no specific conditions are
    selected, all data will be overlaid on a single plot. To display a subset of
    the data, select specific conditions to display (e.g. a specific cell line
    or drug). Mousing over the plot displays the GR values and the corresponding
    concentration. Plots can be downloaded in a variety of image formats.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Dose-Response Grid</strong> shows the fitted dose-response curves
    side by side and grouped according to the selected variables. ‘Selector
    variable’ and ‘grid variable’ define which plots are displayed. ‘Selector
    variable’ also defines the variable displayed in the selector box to the
    left of the plots.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>GR Metric Comparison</strong> shows a scatter plot of the a given GR
    metric across different conditions. Users can select which metric to plot
    relative to which experimental variable. Mousing over the plot displays the
    plotted GR metrics. Plots can be downloaded in a variety of image formats.
  </li>
</ul>
